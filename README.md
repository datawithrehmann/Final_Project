# 🚀 SpaceX Falcon 9 Launch Data Analysis and Prediction

This project is part of the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate (Coursera)**.  
It focuses on analyzing SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launch data to determine the factors that influence the success of first-stage landings. The insights gained from this analysis can help predict whether a future SpaceX launch will successfully land its first stage.

## 🧩 Project Steps

1. **Data Collection**
   - Used SpaceX REST API and Wikipedia web scraping to gather launch data.

2. **Data Wrangling**
   - Cleaned and structured the data for analysis using `pandas`.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Performed EDA using visualization libraries like `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

4. **Interactive Analysis**
   - Built interactive maps and charts with `Folium` and `Plotly`.

5. **Machine Learning**
   - Implemented classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, SVM).
   - Evaluated models based on accuracy and precision.
